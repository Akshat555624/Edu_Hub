TITLE OF THE PROJECT: 
                            “ Edu_hub”

THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In today’s fast pacing competitive world, students want to learn new technologies and excel in their college academics for a better carrier and future. Now, if a student couldn’t attend his/her classes, they certainly search the internet for notes and concept clearance. Now, they literally waste their 25-30 minutes searching for a particular topic on Google, trying to find the perfect link.
So, we claim that our website, ‘Edu_hub’ will certainly solve this problem by providing a platform to students where they can find notes of subjects from class 9 -12. Specially for GLA University students, we will provide subject notes of all CSE subjects of First year to Final year. There will be YouTube links for various coding and educational videos, and some motivational videos for students who sometimes feel low due to their academic pressures.
So, in a nutshell, Edu_hub is a complete platform for students to ease their academic life so that they can perform well in their academics, and can provide sufficient time to themselves to enhance their co-curricular skills.

REASON FOR SELECTING THE TOPIC:
Reason for choosing this topic is to provide a platform to students where they can find all the resources relating to their respective CS domain. We are building a Web browser-based application which will be responsive as well so that students can access our provided content on their smart phones too.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:
The main objective of the Project is to provide a platform where Engineering students get all the information(notes) of the particular subject, instead of wandering on many different sites over Internet. This will reduce their time of searching and help them over their studies.
We will also provide the pdf of all practice sheets which are provided by the teachers in their classes and ppts which are made by teachers(lecturers).
We believe that the Internet should not only be a place for Entertainment and social media, but also be used as a tool to enhance one’s skills and excel in their academics.




FUTURE SCOPE:
The future scope of this Project is to  add links of video lectures for each and every topic of CS Domain as  it will help the students in understanding the topics clearly and precisely.
We will also add the books of renowned authors of 9th class to Engineering (CSE stream).
We will also add the videos regarding tips and for tackling highly competitive exams like the IIT, JEE.
We will also add motivational videos to boost up the self-confidence of the students.
We will also add a blog section in our website where people having knowledge about challenging topics like AI, ML etc. can post their experiences and interact with the students for a healthy and fruitful discussions.
The site will have an attractive newsfeed regarding various articles of Technology related issues so as to keep our Target audience well updated with the future in this domain. 
So, in a nutshell, the scope of this Project is to provide a complete package of resources to students who are interested in CSE domain and want to nurture their skills from a early stage.

METHODOLOGY:
We are building a website which will help students to have all the study materials and related stuffs in one place to help them through their academic life. This is a Dynamic Educational website with a well-made responsive design for Smartphones and Laptop screens.
So, we will follow the following Methodology:
1) Firstly, we will make the Home page and all the pages of the website which will be visible to the user through Frontend Technologies. The pages will be clear and attractive and responsive to the users.
We will add different sections in the navigation bar regarding different subjects, so we will be having pages for each section respectively. In each page, there will be precise content about the topics with various YouTube links for a clear description of concept.
2) After the completion of all the Frontend related stuff, we will move to work on the backend and database part of our website. The search bar will be made using Php and MySQL respectively.
3) Lastly, we will provide a final touch to our Project with Login and Signup pages which will serve as a welcoming page to our users.




HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED:

	Front-End Technologies	

    • HTML   HTML stands for Hypertext Mark-up Language. It is the standard mark-up language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

    • CSS  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work; it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External style sheets are stored in CSS files.

    • JavaScript  JavaScript is a web-based scripting language that has been widely used in web application development in particular, it is often used to add a variety of dynamic functions to web pages, providing users with a smoother and more pleasing browsing experience. In fact, all modern HTML pages use JavaScript.

    • Bootstrap  Bootstrap is a framework to help you design websites faster and easier. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, etc. It also gives you support for JavaScript plugins. Bootstrap’s responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tables and desktops

Back-End Technologies	

    • PHP  PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.

    • MySQL   MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for MySQL however, is for the purpose of a web database.   




CONTRIBUTION THE PROJECT WOULD MAKE:
Our Project is centred on students from class 9 to CSE domain. It will provide various notes and resources to learn and take the pressure off of academics. It could be used as a helpful tool to utilize time, as in the current situation, students intend to clear their concepts by searching for their content on various search engines but end up getting their time and energy wasted. We would provide all the links and resources at one destination, so that students wouldn’t have to wastes their time looking for study materials all over the web.
Since our target audience are the students itself, so our website could be proved to be very helpful for the overall academic balance of the young minds.  

SCOPE FOR EXTENSION INTO A MAJOR PRODUCT:
Our Project is a Dynamic Educational website prototype which focuses on providing resources to users at one destination. For the time being, we will have notes and resources of CSE first year to final year for students of GLA University. We will also have contents for class 9 to 12 Science stream students.
But we believe that our small project could extend into a major product with the help of number of students visiting and using our website. According to the new Educational Reform Policy of India, students will be learning coding from class 6th onwards. So, it’s clear that programming is going to be the new normal for coping with the future technologies. So, our website could help students to develop interest in CS and inculcate the programmer in them.
With the number of users increasing on our websites, our project could become a major website with ads running for revenue. We could also tie up with various different educational websites for our proper growth. Nevertheless, we all team members are very optimistic and excited for this project.

CONCLUSION:
Edu_hub   will be a dynamic website that will provide a one-way destination to users to help them excel their academics. The YouTube links and various videos will help them to visualize the concepts and it will be easy for them to focus on their subjects rather than searching the web and wasting their time.
Our Project use Frontend and little part of Backend development. In the future we will extend the backend part .
We are optimistic that our Project would be able to solve some real-life problems.
